2. Half-day 1

Time allotted: 4 hours out of the class = worth 300 points
Last week, as I completely spent my time working in Jira in creating the tasks and user stories and assigning them to other developers, there is only a little work left as the other developers spending their time in completing the assigned tasks. 
After Monday's class, as per professor feedback, I make sure that the tasks which are previously unassigned in Jira are assigned to everyone, and also
changed the task name with more specific ones like implementation, deployment and also including the team name like whether the particular task comes under design data or data architecture or UI team, so that it will be easy for everyone and also the clients to get to know the progress of the project just by having a look at it.
