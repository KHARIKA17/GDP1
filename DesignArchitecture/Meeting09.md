We have discussed the below points

* Best tool to use for bug tracking is JIRA.
   
  Bug and issue tracking software helps software teams find, record and track bugs in their software. It's important that everyone on your team is able to find and record bugs, and even more important, assign them to the right team members at the right time. 
* We also had a discussion about which deployment tool we are going to use
 - Sarted Working on the user story assigned to me which is about deciding which Tool to use for deployment. So i have gone through all the resources and shortlisted thre deployment tools like Heroku,Azure and AWS. And i had a discussion with my team lead regarding this issue, but it still two more working days to get finalize with the best deployment service. I also had a discussion with Data Team and the UI team about which deployment tool will be the best for our game app.
